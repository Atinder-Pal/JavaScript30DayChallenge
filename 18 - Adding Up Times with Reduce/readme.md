## 18 Adding Up Times width Reduce
We are given an unordered list (Playlist of videos) with list items(individual videos) that have data-time attribute representing the duration of a video. We need to find the total duration o fthe playlist in hours, mins and seconds<br/>
We are provided with the HTML, CSS, and list necessary to create this page/application. All we need is to add JS to add the functionality.

### Notes:
#### JavaScript
1. In order to apply map method on all list items- we need to check if the list items we got back are in array or node list. If in node list- we need to change it to array.
